## Exercise 3 

## Step 1 - Test in Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 (single parameter)

Begin by clicking the "Try the new Teams" switch to move to the new Teams client application.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 only works in the "New" Teams. Please don't miss this step! 

> If you restart your debugger after switching to "New" teams, you may get an error message after the debugger starts. This is a known problem; please just close the error dialog and continue testing.

In the left navigation, click on "M365 Chat" to open Copilot.

Check the lower left of the chat user interface, below the compose box. You should see a plugin icon 1️⃣ . Click this and enable the Northwind Inventory plugin 2️⃣ .

> NOTE: In the Ingite labs you may see a second "Northwind Inventory" app, with an icon that has a yellow background. We've hosted a copy of Northwind Inventory in Microsoft Azure and installed this app into the lab tenants. While it's there as a fallback, if you want to see the queries in your log window you need to use the copy with the blue background, which is the local running copy of the app.

For best results, start a new chat by typing "New chat" before each prompt or set of related prompts.

Here are some prompts to try that use only a single parameter of the message extension:

* "Find information about Chai in Northwind Inventory"

* "Find discounted seafood in Northwind. Show a table with the products, supplier names, average discount rate, and revenue per period."

* "Find high revenue Northwind products. Did we run any ad campaigns for them?"

See if this last one also locates any of the documents you uploaded to your OneDrive.

You may see citations of the Northwind data in 3 forms. If there's a single reference, Copilot may show the whole card.

If there are multiple references, Copilot may show a small number next to each. You can hover over these numbers to display the adaptive card.  Also, it may show a pull-down below the "Copy" button.

Try using these adaptive cards to take action on the products. Notice that this doesn't affect earlier responses from Copilot.

Feel free to try making up your own prompts. You'll find that they only work if Copilot is able to query the plugin for the required information. This underscores the need to anticipate the kinds of prompts users will issue, and providing corresponding types of queries for each one. Having multiple parameters will make this more powerful!

## Step 2 - Test in Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365 (multiple parameters)

In this exercise, you'll try some prompts that exercise the multi-parameter feature in the sample plugin. These prompts will request data that can be retrieved by name, category, inventory status, supplier city, and stock level, as defined in [the manifest](../appPackage/manifest.json).

For example, try prompting "Find Northwind beverages with more than 100 items in stock". To respond, Copilot must identify products:

* where the category is "beverages"
* where inventory status is "in stock"
* where the stock level is more than 100

The plugin code applies all three filters, providing a result set of just 4 products. Using the information on the 4 resulting adaptive cards, Copilot renders a result similar to this:

![Copilot produced a bulleted list of products with references](./images/03-06b-Find-Northwind-Beverages-with-more-than-100.png)

Now try a follow-up prompt (without starting a new chat):

"What are the payment terms for these suppliers?"

This prompt won't use your plug-in but if it looks in your OneDrive files it should be able to find the payment terms with each supplier's contract.

Here are some more prompts to try:

* "Find Northwind dairy products that are low on stock. Show me a table with the product, supplier, units in stock and on order."

* "We’ve been receiving partial orders for Tofu. Find the supplier in Northwind and draft an email summarizing our inventory and reminding them they should stop sending partial orders per our MOQ policy."

* "Northwind will have a booth at Microsoft Community Days  in London. Find products with local suppliers and write a LinkedIn post to promote the booth and products."

    Request an enhancement by prompting,

    "Emphasize how delicious the products are and encourage people to attend our booth"

* "What beverage is high in demand due to social media that is low stock in Northwind in London. Reference the product details to update stock."

Which prompts work best for you? Try making up your own prompts and observe your log messages to see how Copilot accesses your plugin.

## Congratulations

You have completed Exercise 3.
Please proceed to [Exercise 4](Exercise%2004%20-%20Code%20tour.md) in which you will explore the plugin source code and adaptive cards.
